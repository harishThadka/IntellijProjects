1) Minimum distance between 2 words counting the number of characters from middle of both words.
 E.g. ABC is XYZ and ABC & XYZ are two distinct words. Minimum distance between ABC and XYZ

2) First unique character of a string. E.g. aabdcce . Output : d

3) Largest substring with unique(without repeating) characters e.g. aaabcbdeaf Output : cbdeaf
longest substring with atleast k repeating charcters
longest substring with atmost k distinct characters

4) Running Length encoding of a Strings
	i/p: aabbccaaa  o/p: a2b2c2a3
	
5) Max occurance of a charecter in the String with index and its max count
		i/p: aabbbbbbbbbbccccc o/p: char='b' index=2 count=10

6)Program to print smallest and biggest possible palindrome word in a given string

7)Missing characters to make a string Pangram

8)determine whether two strings are the anagram
i/p: String str1="Brag";  
        String str2="Grab";  
0/p: true		
		

9)determine whether one string is a rotation of another
i/p: String 1: abcde   String 2: deabc  
o/p: Second string is a rotation of first string

10)	Reserve a string in Java without using reverse function
